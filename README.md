# basskick-sampler

VST3-Plugin for using cloud-hosted samples. Anyone using this plugin can upload/download Samples and play with them in a tiny, nice, vst-plugin. It's possible to layer samples and even add some effects to them.

## What is it?

We all download samples sometimes and use the internal sampler of our DAW or even use a VST-Plugin for playing samples. That's great but every sampler-plugin either needs us to download a sample and drag and drop it into it. Or it has an own propriate format or you need to download the sample-pack via browser and install it in your sampler.

My intention is is to give you a sample-downloader _and_ uploader packed in one simple VST.
